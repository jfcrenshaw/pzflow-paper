Journal article for [PZFlow](https://jfcrenshaw.github.io/pzflow/) created using the [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) workflow.

To build the article:

1. install [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork)
2. run `showyourwork` from the base of the repo.

Note the auto-build on Github isn't currently working due to issues with the remote cache that I have no plans to fix it. But you can still run-from-scratch locally.
